    "# Creating Workers Dynamically In Langgraph\n",

    "Because orchestrator-worker workflows are common, LangGraph has the Send API to support this. It lets you dynamically create worker nodes and send each one a specific input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Worker State Management\n",
    "Each worker has its own state, and all worker outputs are written to a shared state key that is accessible to the orchestrator graph. This gives the orchestrator access to all worker output and allows it to synthesize them into a final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "As you can see below, we iterate over a list of sections and Send each to a worker node."

       "**Executive Summary: Agentic AI RAGs**\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Points:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Definition of Agentic AI RAGs**: Agentic AI RAGs (Red, Amber, Green) are a framework for assessing the readiness of AI systems to perform tasks autonomously. This framework helps organizations evaluate the level of autonomy and decision-making capabilities of AI systems.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Current Status**: Our current assessment indicates that most AI systems are still in the Red category, with significant limitations in their ability to make decisions and take actions independently.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Challenges and Risks**: The primary challenges and risks associated with Agentic AI RAGs include the lack of transparency, accountability, and explainability in AI decision-making processes. This can lead to potential biases, errors, and unintended consequences.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Recommendations**: To move AI systems from the Red category to the Amber or Green category, we recommend the following:\n",
       "\t* Implementing transparent and explainable AI decision-making processes.\n",
       "\t* Developing robust testing and validation protocols to ensure AI systems can handle complex situations.\n",
       "\t* Establishing clear accountability and governance frameworks for AI decision-making.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Future Outlook**: As AI technology continues to evolve, we expect to see significant advancements in Agentic AI RAGs. However, it is crucial to address the challenges and risks associated with these systems to ensure their safe and effective deployment.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Action Plan**: Our team will continue to monitor and assess the readiness of AI systems using the Agentic AI RAGs framework. We will also work with stakeholders to develop and implement strategies for addressing the challenges and risks associated with these systems.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "**Introduction and Description: Basic Definition and Background Information about Agentic AI RAGs**\n",
       "\n",
       "**Definition and Scope**\n",
       "\n",
       "Agentic AI RAGs, short for Reasonable and Accountable Goals (RAGs), refer to a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) systems that exhibit autonomous goal-directed behavior while maintaining accountability and transparency. These AI systems are designed to navigate complex environments, make decisions, and achieve objectives in a way that aligns with human values and societal norms.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Background and History**\n",
       "\n",
       "The concept of Agentic AI RAGs has its roots in the field of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which aims to create AI systems that possess human-like intelligence, including reasoning, problem-solving, and learning capabilities. The development of Agentic AI RAGs draws from various disciplines, including cognitive science, computer science, and philosophy of mind. Researchers have been exploring the design of AI systems that can learn from experience, adapt to new situations, and make decisions that are aligned with human values.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Characteristics and Features**\n",
       "\n",
       "Agentic AI RAGs are designed to possess the following key characteristics and features:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Autonomy**: The ability to operate independently and make decisions without human intervention.\n",
       "2. **Goal-directed behavior**: The capacity to set and pursue goals, including the ability to adapt to changing circumstances.\n",
       "3. **Reasoning and problem-solving**: The ability to reason, learn, and solve complex problems.\n",
       "4. **Accountability and transparency**: The ability to provide explanations and justifications for their actions and decisions.\n",
       "5. **Value alignment**: The ability to align their goals and actions with human values and societal norms.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Implications and Applications**\n",
       "\n",
       "The development of Agentic AI RAGs has significant implications for various fields, including AI research, robotics, and decision-making systems. Potential applications of Agentic AI RAGs include:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Autonomous systems**: Agentic AI RAGs can be used to develop autonomous systems that can navigate complex environments and make decisions in real-time.\n",
       "2. **Decision-making systems**: Agentic AI RAGs can be used to develop decision-making systems that can provide transparent and accountable recommendations.\n",
       "3. **Robotics**: Agentic AI RAGs can be used to develop autonomous robots that can perform tasks and interact with humans in a way that is aligned with human values.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Conclusion**\n",
       "\n",
       "Agentic AI RAGs represent a significant advancement in the field of AI research, offering a promising approach to developing AI systems that are autonomous, accountable, and aligned with human values.
