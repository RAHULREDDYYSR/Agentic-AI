    "# Creating Workers Dynamically In Langgraph\n",

    "Because orchestrator-worker workflows are common, LangGraph has the Send API to support this. It lets you dynamically create worker nodes and send each one a specific input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Worker State Management\n",
    "Each worker has its own state, and all worker outputs are written to a shared state key that is accessible to the orchestrator graph. This gives the orchestrator access to all worker output and allows it to synthesize them into a final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "As you can see below, we iterate over a list of sections and Send each to a worker node."

       "**Introduction and Description: Background on Amazon Kiro and the Need for a New IDE**\n",
       "\n",
       "Amazon Kiro is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that has been gaining popularity among software developers due to its innovative features and user-friendly interface. However, in recent years, Amazon Kiro has faced significant challenges in keeping up with the rapidly evolving needs of modern software development. The increasing complexity of software projects, the rise of DevOps and agile methodologies, and the growing demand for cloud-native applications have created a pressing need for a new IDE that can meet the demands of modern software development.\n",
       "\n",
       "Despite Amazon Kiro's efforts to improve its features and performance, several limitations and drawbacks have become apparent. The IDE's interface has become cluttered and difficult to navigate, leading to increased cognitive load and decreased productivity among developers. Additionally, Amazon Kiro's integration with other tools and services has become cumbersome, hindering its ability to support seamless collaboration and automation.\n",
       "\n",
       "Furthermore, the increasing adoption of cloud-native applications and microservices architecture has created a need for an IDE that can support the development of distributed systems. Amazon Kiro's lack of support for these architectures has made it a barrier to entry for many developers, limiting its adoption and use.\n",
       "\n",
       "In light of these challenges, there is a pressing need for a new IDE that can address the limitations of Amazon Kiro and provide a more efficient, effective, and user-friendly experience for software developers. A new IDE that can support the evolving needs of modern software development, including cloud-native applications and microservices architecture, is essential for driving innovation and productivity in the software industry.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "**Features and Functionality**\n",
       "\n",
       "The newly developed IDE boasts a comprehensive range of features and functionalities designed to enhance the development experience for programmers. Some of the key capabilities include:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Advanced Code Editor**: The IDE features a powerful code editor with syntax highlighting, code completion, and real-time error checking. This enables developers to write and debug code more efficiently.\n",
       "- **Project Management**: The IDE includes a robust project management system that allows developers to create, organize, and manage their projects with ease. This includes features such as project templates, version control integration, and deployment tools.\n",
       "- **Debugging and Testing**: The IDE provides a comprehensive debugging and testing framework that enables developers to identify and fix errors quickly. This includes features such as breakpoints, step-through debugging, and automated testing.\n",
