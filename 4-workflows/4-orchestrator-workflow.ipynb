    "# Creating Workers Dynamically In Langgraph\n",

    "Because orchestrator-worker workflows are common, LangGraph has the Send API to support this. It lets you dynamically create worker nodes and send each one a specific input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Worker State Management\n",
    "Each worker has its own state, and all worker outputs are written to a shared state key that is accessible to the orchestrator graph. This gives the orchestrator access to all worker output and allows it to synthesize them into a final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "As you can see below, we iterate over a list of sections and Send each to a worker node."
